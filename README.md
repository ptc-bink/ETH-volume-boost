# Volume Boosting Bot for Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain

## Overview

Designed for **automated token trading and boosting** across Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This bot uses smart contracts to perform lightning-fast buy and sell operations on decentralized exchanges like **Uniswap** (v2/v3), ensuring optimal liquidity and rapid volume growth for your token.

This is built with **anti-MEV** (Maximal Extractable Value) functionality, robust **security measures**, and **transaction optimization** to minimize gas costs while maximizing the impact of each trade. Whether you want to **boost token liquidity**, create a **buy-sell volume effect**, or manage **automated market-making**, this bot has got you covered.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automated Buy/Sell Transactions**
   - **Buy and Sell Tokens in One Transaction**: The bot automates buying and selling ERC20 tokens with a single call to Uniswap, ensuring swift execution and volume boosting.
   - **Instant Sell After Buy**: As soon as a buy transaction is executed, the bot immediately proceeds with a sell order to secure profits and prevent loss.
   - **1ETH Per Transaction**: For cost optimization, each transaction is executed with 1ETH, reducing gas fees while maintaining effective market impact.

### 2. **Anti-MEV and Market Safeguards**
   - **RPC Anti-MEV**: Built-in protection against Maximal Extractable Value attacks, ensuring fair and transparent transactions.
   - **Token Selection Criteria**: Only tokens with **at least 250k market cap** and **5ETH LP** are eligible for trading. This ensures you’re not investing in low-cap or illiquid projects.
   - **Token Audit**: Integrated with **QuickIntel.io** for real-time audits, checking for potential honeypots, rug pulls, and ensuring the project is safe before any trading occurs.
   
### 3. **Liquidity Pool Management**
   - **ETH Pair Only**: The bot will only initiate orders in **ETH pairs** to maintain consistency and reduce unnecessary risks.
   - **DEX Support**: Currently supports trading on **Uniswap v2/v3**, ensuring access to the most liquid decentralized exchanges.
   
### 4. **Enhanced Security & Risk Mitigation**
   - **Transaction Monitoring**: If a user tries to sell after the bot buys, an immediate sell transaction is triggered to avoid loss.
   - **Automated Stop Conditions**: The bot will **pause** when the wallet balance reaches **1.01 ETH** to prevent the accumulation of tokens with high fees.

### 5. **Multi-Option Trading**
   - **Multiple Options for Traders**: Two modes are available for users: **BUNDLE** or **Normal**. Both options offer different approaches to volume boosting, allowing flexibility in trading strategy.

### 6. **Wallet Transfer**
   - **After 20 Transactions**: To prevent detection of the boost algorithm, the bot will automatically transfer funds to another wallet after executing 20 transactions.
